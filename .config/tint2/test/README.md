I can't give every theme preview one by one, but You can view My Deviant Art [Gallery](http://addy-dclxvi.deviantart.com/gallery/).
Every of my tint2 setups are using these themes.
## Getting Started
You need tint2 with executor support for some of my tint2 themes
## Installation
Do it Yourself :p
## Caution
- Executor scripts & icons path placement are hardcoded, so place this tint2 themes to ~/.config/tint2

- Executor scripts are derived from i3blocks module. I tested it doesn't work if the machine never run i3blocks at least once.

- Icons path for *.desktop files are hardcoded to /home/addy/.config/tint2/.launcher*/icons/ (Yup, there is my username), so edit the *.desktop files first

- xfwm tint2 is designed for 4 workspaces & 1366 px width

- tiling tint2 is designed for 8 workspaces & 1366 px width, I'm using it for herbstluftwm 

- I don't know about code, most of these are built using tint2conf GUI. So these tint2 config files are very dirty, with so many useless code

- Weather executor script need API key from openweathermap.com, so please sign up first. And don't forget to change your city code as well.

- Bookmark launcher tint2 is launching Firefox on click. Don't love Firefox? Just edit the *.desktop files.


## Credits
[BunsenLabs Forum](https://forums.bunsenlabs.org/viewtopic.php?id=254), I learn so much there.
[ARCHLabs Github](https://github.com/ARCHLabs/Archlabs-Tint2-Themes), one of my main resouces for learning.
[Anachron i3blocks](https://github.com/Anachron/i3blocks), I try to execute an i3block script using tint2 executor, without any expectation it will work.
But ridiculously it works! So I slightly modify it to fit into my tint2 themes.
